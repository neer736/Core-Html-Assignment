    <h1>What is Web Development ?</h1>
    <p>
        Web Development is about creating, building and maintaining websites or web applications that run into browser.in web development we creat websites or web apps as well. A website or a application can be on dekstop on or on your phone basically there is no diffrence in websites or web appplications because every dynamic websites are web applications , so they both are interchangable words. We can devide Web Development in 2 parts : <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Front End web Development</li>
            <li>Back End web Development</li>
        </ol>
        1.Front End web Development : Front End web Development is the visual part of the website we aslo known as clint side web development. in frontend web development a developer creates a interactive part of website which shows on web or we can say that frontend is the part which is interacted by user directly in their web browser. front is all about just 3 things : <br> 
        <ol>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>JAVASCRIPT</li>
        </ol>
        1.HTML : HTML(Hyper Text Markup Language) is The base or we can say its the foundation of frontend web development . it creates a structure of web pages.its like skeleton of web pages. we write our structure
        in HTML with the help of tags. we can insert images,links,headings,lists,tables,forms and many more things in html to make our webpage beautiful and interactive. <br> <br>

        2.CSS(Cascading Style Sheets) : with the help of CSS,Developer can control the styling part of web pages. it allows developer to change color,font,spacing,positioning of HTML elements.so in short html can build layout or structure of web pages and css can make them beautiful and stylish. <br> There are 3 ways of applying css these are : <br>
        (1) Inline CSS <br>
        (2) Internal CSS <br>
        (3) External CSS <br> <br><br>

        (1)Inline CSS : When we apply css on directly html element by writing style tag within line thats called Inline CSS we use style tag for applying this. <br>
        (2)Internal CSS : In Internal css we apply css on same webpage but under the style tag ( in head tag) we makes a style tag then apply css on all tags or paragraph and divs those we want to apply. <br>
        (3)External CSS : In External CSS we creat an external css file and link it to our html page with the help of link tag after linking we can apply css style our html page. <br><br>



        3.JAVASCRIPT : Javascript is a programming language which is object Oriented, clint site scripting,interactive etc.JS is used to creat interective effects on web browser.with the help of js developer can make dynamic websites.js performs the logical opration on the code which is written in html and css basically it makes live to webpage. developer can control html and css both by Javascript.js can manipulate and validate data. <br><br>
        2. Back-End Web Development : back end web development is the part of web development that focus on server site of a web application. it does creation and maintaining of the server,database and logics that gives the power to web applicate to perform operations. <br>
         there are some frameworks or librarie and database that makes js powerful. <br><br>

         (1)Node.js : Node.js is the most popular backend framework for creating server side Javascript.It is an open source server side runtime environment that allows developers to run Javascript code on server. Node.js helps bridge the devide between server and clint. <br><br>

         (2)Express.js : Express.js is a back end application framework for creating APIs using Javascript.it can also provide server side functionality. Express.js usually used with Node.js to provide a server framework that enebles Node.js to perform a server side backend scripting language. <br><br>

         (3)MongoDB : MongoDB is popular and open source NoSQL (Not only SQL)database managenent system, developers store database in it. Records in MongoDB database are called documents, and the field value includes numbers,strings,arrays,booleas or nested Documents. MongoDB is used for high volume data storage or we can say large sets of data. <br><br>

         (4)React.js : React.js is popular and open source
          Javascript library for building UI(user interface) . it is created by Facebook.it is used for creating dynamic and interactive web applications. React allows developers to build reusable UI components. it is used to update user interface and response to changes in data. <br><br>

          MongoDB + Express.js + React.js + Node.js = MERN Stack.
